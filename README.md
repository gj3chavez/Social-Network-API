# Description
This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses `Express.js` for routing, a `MongoDB` database, the `Mongoose ODM` and `Moment.js` to format timestamps. `Insomnia` was used to create data.
